<p>HI<p>
<p>I'm Ivan<p>
<p>I'm 15<p>
<p>I'm learning German<p>
<p>It's very difficult, but I'm sure I can handle it<p>
<p>I am Ukrainian, but I have been living in Austria for three years now<p>
<p>it's better here in Austria than in Ukraine, at least you can ride a tram here, and it's also very beautiful here, although there's almost no snow in winter<p>
<p>but there are also problems, for example, I have only 2 friends, and they take 20 minutes to get to the first one, and 1 hour to get to the second one<P>
<p>I also don't understand anything, I haven't been able to move to the next class for 3 years now because I have poor grades in non-German and English<p>
<p>most importantly, due to the fact that I hardly go anywhere, I like writing python code, it was too complicated, so I started learning html, this is my first robot)<p>
